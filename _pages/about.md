I am a senior undergraduate student at the **[University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/)**, double majoring in **[Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/)** and **[Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/)**.

My research interests lie broadly in **Artificial Intelligence**, with a specific focus on **Trustworthy AI**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Agentic Systems**. My current goal is to build AI systems that are robust against adversarial attacks and transparent through structured observability.

Currently, I am a Researcher on Trustworthy Agentic AI at UC Berkeley, advised by **[Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/)**, focusing on structured observability for agent systems. Simultaneously, I conduct independent research on adversarial robustness for LVLMs at the **[Blender Lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/)** (UIUC), advised by **[Prof. Qingyun Wang](https://eaglew.github.io/)** (now at William & Mary).

Previously, I was selected for the **[Summer Research Programme (SRP)](https://datascience.hku.hk/study/summer-research-programme/)** at **[HKU-EEE](https://www.eee.hku.hk/)**, where I developed a physics-aware 3D generation pipeline advised by **[Prof. Xihui Liu](https://xh-liu.github.io/)**. I also served as a Lead Developer at the **[Levi Lab](https://www.levilabberkeley.org/)** (UC Berkeley), engineering computational frameworks for vision and eye movement modeling under **[Prof. Dennis Levi](https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/)**.

I am actively applying for **Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026**.
